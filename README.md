# Welcome to Tensorflow!

Hi! I'm Jaeseok Yoon, This repository is a space for studying about tensorflow. I am currently studying tensorflow through **Book** and **YouTube**.

The book study is proceeding with [Golbin Hacker's 3 minute deep learning tensorflow](https://github.com/golbin/TensorFlow-Tutorials) of [@golbin](https://github.com/golbin/)

Youtube study is proceeding with [Deep learning for everyone](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlMkM4tgfjnLSOjrEJN31gZATbcj_MpUm) of [Professor Kim](https://github.com/hunkim/).
